<h1>Consider the good and mighty deeds of the Lord. Look at where He has brought me. He knows my name. He has crafted my heart. He will not let me down. The Lord is good. Consider Dave, that you know the LORD, Your GOD. You need not fret. You need not fear. He has His angels watching over you. His light and Life are INSIDE YOU. You are not alone. Though this feels like waste and obscurity, it is for purposes you cannot see. The Lord is doing a great and mighty work. Consider that all things have a purpose. Nothing is in vain. Though there is darkness, there will always remain the sun.</h1>
